# frostfire_chart_detect

Frostfire Chart Detect is a machine learning project focused on using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify images as either price charts or non-charts. The project is designed for financial engineers, traders, and developers looking to integrate automated chart detection into their workflows.

### Features:
- Binary classification: Chart vs. Not Chart.
- Pre-trained and custom CNN models for efficient training.
- Diverse datasets including stock and crypto charts, as well as unrelated images for non-chart classification.
- Scalable and modular codebase for easy integration and experimentation.

### Applications:
- Financial data preprocessing pipelines.
- Real-time chart detection for trading systems.
- Enhanced document analysis for financial reports.
